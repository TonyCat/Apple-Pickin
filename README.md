An Appcelerator game using quicktimegame2d that can be seamlessly converted to platino.

Greetings fellow Appcelerator developers!!
I created this sample project to demonstrate how you can create a game using 
Appcelerator titanium!
 

I'm using tiquickgame2d in this current sample but this can easily be converted to
Lanica's Platino engine by swapping out the namespace and using Platino.

I ran out of time with the Platino Beta but I had some real cool features 
I wish I could show but If you were ever wondering how to make a game in 
Titanium this is a very simple example that will show you a way to use sprites

I originally had this in an Alloy project and commented out some code so if you wanted to use Alloy it 
should be pretty easy to see how to move it back into an alloy project.

I'd love some feedback and suggestions and give me a STAR!!!!
